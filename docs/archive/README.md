## Why These Are Archived

These documents were created during the development and implementation phases of WarDragon Analytics. They served important purposes:

1. **Communication between agents** during collaborative implementation
2. **Verification and validation** of deliverables
3. **Implementation tracking** and progress documentation
4. **Technical reference** during development

However, they are **not intended for end users** (operators, system administrators). The information has been consolidated into user-facing documentation:

- **API_REFERENCE.md** - Replaces PATTERN_API_QUICKREF.md
- **OPERATOR_GUIDE.md** - Replaces WEB_UI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md and includes operational workflows
- **GRAFANA_DASHBOARDS.md** - New comprehensive dashboard guide
- **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - New troubleshooting and support guide
- **README.md** - Updated with Phase 2 features and clear navigation
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Consolidated deployment guide

## When to Reference These Files

You may want to reference archived files for:

- **Development history** - Understanding design decisions
- **Implementation details** - Deep technical specifics not in user docs
- **Agent handoffs** - Understanding how multi-agent collaboration worked
- **Future phases** - Learning from Phase 1 and Phase 2 implementation patterns
