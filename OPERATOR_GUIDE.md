## Troubleshooting

### No Drones Showing in Dashboards

**Check**:
1. Kits are online (Kit Status Grid shows green)
2. Collector service is running (`docker-compose ps collector`)
3. Database has data (`docker exec wardragon-timescaledb psql -U wardragon -d wardragon -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drones;"`)

**Solution**:
- Generate test data: `python tests/generate_test_data.py --scenario normal`
- Verify kits.yaml configuration is correct
- Check collector logs: `docker-compose logs collector`

### Pattern Detection Not Working

**Check**:
1. Sufficient data exists (patterns require multiple detections over time)
2. Time range is appropriate (try increasing `hours` parameter)
3. API is responding (`curl http://localhost:8090/health`)

**Solution**:
- Generate pattern test data: `python tests/generate_test_data.py --scenario all`
- Verify database views exist (check `init.sql`)
- Restart web service: `docker-compose restart web`

### Grafana Dashboards Not Loading

**Check**:
1. Grafana is running (`docker-compose ps grafana`)
2. TimescaleDB datasource is configured
3. Dashboards are provisioned (check `/grafana/provisioning/`)

**Solution**:
- Restart Grafana: `docker-compose restart grafana`
- Check Grafana logs: `docker-compose logs grafana`
- Verify datasource at http://localhost:3000/datasources
